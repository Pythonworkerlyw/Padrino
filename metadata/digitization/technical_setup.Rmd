### Initial setup

Once you've set up GitHub and RStudio to talk to each other, it will be useful to create a local copy of the Padrino repository on your computer. This will give you access to, among other things, local copies of this guide and the others, as well as a the "Email an Author" template. To do this:

1. Open Rstudio

2. In the top right corner, there will be a "Project: (None)" tab. Click this dropdown, and select "New Project".

3. Select "Version Control" from the first menu.

4. Select "Git" from the second menu.

5. Enter `https://github.com/levisc8/Padrino` into the "Repository URL" bar. Select a directory to place your version in using the "Create project as subdirectory of:".

6. Click "Create" button.

7. Once all files are downloaded and the new R session is started, click on the Git tab. This will usually be in the same Pane as the Environment and History tabs in RStudio.

8. Once in that tab, click "New Branch" and give your branch an easily recognizable name (e.g. "sam_branch"). The name should not have any spaces or apostrophes. 

You can now safely edit documents and add notes as you like without affecting the main branch. Test this out by inserting an innocuous change to a document (e.g. add a space or line break), commit the change, and push it to your branch. Go to the repository in the web browser, and select the branch drop down (it will be a little tab that says "main" on the left side of the screen above the files pane). Select your branch - you should see your commit message pop up when you switch over.
