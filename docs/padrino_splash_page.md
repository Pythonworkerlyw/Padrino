Padrino & Madrina
-----------------

`Padrino` is a package for interacting with the *PADRINO IPM* and *MADRINA IPM* databases. It consists of wrappers to an SQL database that itself houses a suite of all known, published integral projection models. The project is in its infancy and thus the database is not queryable yet, but we hope to change in that in the coming months.

The *PADRINO IPM Database* aims to provide a centralized repository of all known integral projection models for plants. The *MADRINA IPM Database* aims to do the same, but for animals. These are modeled after the [COMPADRE & COMADRE](http://www.compadre-db.org/) databases which themselves host all known matrix population models (but are much more well developed).

The current digitization and functional capacity building team consists of Sam Levin (iDiv), Rob Salguero-Gomez (University of Oxford), and Dylan Childs (University of Sheffield). Eelke Jongejans (Radboud University) and Steve Ellner (Cornell University) have also contributed invaluable insights to the project.

### Want to contribute?

Much like the databases, this website is also in its infancy. We welcome collaborators who would like to help build out the functionality of this database. Please contact us at <padrinocontact@gmail.com> for more details on how to contribute!
