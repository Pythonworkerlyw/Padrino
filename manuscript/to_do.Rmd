# to-do for PDB paper

1. ipmr update to include auto-reporting needs to go to CRAN

    + Add in eric scott's suggestions too
    
    + Mostly done, wrangling with CRAN now (4/27/22)
    
2. Update Rpadrino CRAN version so code in box in can run off the shelf (no remotes::install)

    + Awaiting CRAN Acceptance

3. update figure 1, it's trash.

    + Mostly done

4. Add more to appendix about contributing to PADRINO, and warnings/messages that appear during builds.

    + Add padrino_warning class? ipmr_warning class?
    
        + Added as vignette - no specific warning classes yet
        
        + Awaiting CRAN Acceptance
    
    + Too late on ipmr_warning(?)
