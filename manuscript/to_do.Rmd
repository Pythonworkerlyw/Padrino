1. ipmr update to include auto-reporting needs to go to CRAN

    + Add in eric scott's suggestions too

2. Update Rpadrino CRAN version so code in box in can run off the shelf (no remotes::install)

3. update figure 1, it's trash.

    + Mostly done (4/29/22)

4. Add more to appendix about contributing to PADRINO, and warnings/messages that appear during builds.

        + Awaiting CRAN Acceptance
    
    + Too late on ipmr_warning(?)
