## Padrino  <a href='https://levisc8.github.io/Padrino'><img src='metadata/pdb_logo.png' align="right" height="139" /></a>

This repo hosts the code used to generate and upload data to the `Padrino` data base. This is more for back end management and to help Padri√±os to find their way as they get started. I've created a separate repo called `RPadrino` that will be eventually become the equivalent of `Rcompadre`.

Currently, the data base is an Excel file with 11 tables and consists of ASCII representation of model formulae, the coefficients associated with said models, and the upper/lower bounds of the state variables. We are closing in on a finalized design, at which point it seems likely that this will transition to an SQL instance hosted remotely. Eventually, it would be nice to be able to generate `.rda` objects (a la Compadre) and/or query it directly from R through an API. 

For now, all commits will go to the `main` branch as this is still so early in development that keeping a separate `devel` branch is pointless. This will change immediately before/after the first major release.

If you think of others who could/should contribute, please let me know and I'll add them!

Development of the package `RPadrino` is taking place over [here](https://github.com/levisc8/RPadrino).

## For Compadrinos

The digitization guide and other help files are located in `metadata/digitization` and on the project's [webpage](https://levisc8.github.io/Padrino/). The [pdbDigitUtils](https://github.com/levisc8/pdbDigitUtils) package can help detect some problems with freshly digitized models.
