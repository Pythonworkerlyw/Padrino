Padrino
=======

`Padrino` is a package for interacting with the demography data base of the same name. It will likely consist of wrappers to an SQL data base that itself houses a suite of all known, published integral projection models. Currently, it does not exist (::*sad trombone*::), but we hope to change in that in the coming months.

Currently, it seems that the SQL data base itself should consist of ASCII representation of model formulae, the coefficients associated with said models, and the upper/lower bounds of the state variables. That said, I'm open to ideas for alternative implementations as I'm not sure that will cover all the information needed to re-create more complicated IPMs. Alternative ideas should be discussed in the *Issues* tab to keep everything centralized.

##### Note: The repo is set to private and will be for the forseeable future. Keep this in mind when sharing code in this repo with others!!!

For now, all commits will go to the `master` branch as this is still so early in development that keeping a separate `devel` branch is pointless. This will change in the future.

If you think of others who could/should contribute, please let me know and I'll add them!
