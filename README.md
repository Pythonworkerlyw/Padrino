Padrino
=======

This repo hosts the code used to generate and upload data to the `Padrino` data base. In other words, this is more for back end management and to help COMPADRINOs (we need a better name for this one) to find their way as they get started. I've created a separate repo called `RPadrino` that will be eventually become the equivalent of `Rcompadre`.

Currently, it seems that the SQL data base itself should consist of ASCII representation of model formulae, the coefficients associated with said models, and the upper/lower bounds of the state variables. That said, I'm open to ideas for alternative implementations as I'm not sure that will cover all the information needed to re-create more complicated IPMs. Alternative ideas should be discussed in the *Issues* tab to keep everything centralized.

##### Note: The repo is set to private and will be for the forseeable future. Keep this in mind when sharing code in this repo with others!!!

For now, all commits will go to the `master` branch as this is still so early in development that keeping a separate `devel` branch is pointless. This will change in the future.

If you think of others who could/should contribute, please let me know and I'll add them!

You can visit the project's webpage [here](https://levisc8.github.io/Padrino.github.io/).

Development of the package `RPadrino` is taking place over [here](https://github.com/levisc8/RPadrino).
